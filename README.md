## Background
Study shows that customers care about the price the most when purchasing a new phone. Therefore, we provide a swift tool to predict prices that our customers and sellers can use as a benchmark. When sellers write a description for a new product that they are willing to sell, a corresponding price would be recommended based on the content of the title and description. Once we implement this feature, sellers would be more careful when they are pricing new products or writing descriptions, making the customers collect information more accessible and refining the user experience.
